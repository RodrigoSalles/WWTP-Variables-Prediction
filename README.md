# WWTP-Variables-Prediction
## Repository associated with the WCCI 2022 paper "Prediction of Key Variables in Wastewater Treatment Plants Using Machine Learning Models". Paper presented at the WCCI 2022 conference in Padua, Italy 18-23 July.

## The objective of this work is to predict key variables in the wastewater treatment process, carried out in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).

The results presented in paper “Prediction of Key Variables in Wastewater Treatment Plants Using Machine Learning Models” are associated with four notebooks, one notebook for each key variable of the case studies.
The datasets used come from the BSM2 simulator. More details about the installation and operation of BSM2 can be found here https://github.com/wwtmodels and here https://wwtmodels.pubpub.org.
